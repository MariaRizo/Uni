<p>Hi! I'm Mary Rizo, and I'm a free artist. I study at Narva Estonian High School and paint at my spare time. I have already completed some orders and projects - painted a moto helmet for my teacher, a hockey helmet for my friend and designed a wall in the music room of the local youth club. Now Iâ€™m working on a new project- decorating a motorcycle with a hockey theme.</p>
<p>My artistic journey started at Narva Art School - I learned basic drawing techniques, challenged myself with different tasks and tried to find my own place in the world of art. Sure, some of my earliest works better be hidden in the attic but I decided to come out completely and show you the evidence of my evolution. Trust me , I have come a long way!</p>
